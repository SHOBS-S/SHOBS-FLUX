"""SHOBS-FLUX: checks that this Python can run SHOBS-FLUX. Used by setup_python.ps1; it changes nothing.

Prints SHOBSPY=<full path of this python.exe> and exits 0 when this Python will do; otherwise prints one line saying
why not and exits non-zero. With --packages it also checks that the packages in requirements.txt import.
With --tk86 (used by shobs_setup.sh on Linux and Mac) it also refuses a Tk older than 8.6, e.g. the Tk 8.5 of old
Mac Pythons.
Written without f-strings so that an old Python 2 or 3.5 still reports its version instead of a syntax error.
